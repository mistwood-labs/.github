# mistwood-labs

mistwood-labs is a small laboratory quietly exploring new decentralized architectures.

We are currently developing early experimental protocols focused on silent communication, resilience, and new models of trust.

Our projects remain private during the exploration phase.  
More information will be shared when the time is right.

## Status

- Active early-stage research
- Proof-of-concept development ongoing
- Gradual public disclosure planned

## Contact

We are not actively seeking publicity.  
If you find us, it may be enough.
